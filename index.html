<h1>What is  "Forex "?</h1>

When you decide to take this training, of course you have never heard of "Forex". As an introduction, we will discuss forex itself.<br />
What exactly is "Forex"? FOREX is an acronym for "Foreign Exchange". If we translate freely, the foreign exchange is a foreign currency exchange. The term that we hear more often is foreign exchange (forex).<br />
<br />
If we talk Forex (FX), then we talk about the value of a currency against another currency. In other words, the currency compared to the Niliiah against the other currency. The difference in the value of both currencies is what we then call "currency" or "exchange rate". We take the closest example to our daily life of the US Dollar (USD) in our country's currency: Rupiah (IDR). The comparison of USD with IDR is what we then know with "dollar rate against rupiah". If we look at the banks or money changer, or if we also observe the development of foreign exchange in television or newspaper, the dollar exchange rate against the rupiah is often written with a rate of USD/IDR.<br />
In the last ten years, the development of forex trading (Forex trading) in Indonesia is very fast. Almost all walks of life have known forex or even directly involved in forex trading. It is quite natural considering the opportunities that can be achieved in forex trading is very large. The amount of opportunity is because the money market is the largest financial market in the world, considering that all the economic activities in the world must come to the currency. Its daily Volume reaches USD 4 trillion per day! It can even be said that the money market will still run as long as humans still do economic activity. In fact, if we transact forex online, we can make transactions whenever we want 24 hours a day and five days a week (Monday to Friday).<br />
<br />
The following is a chart comparison between the average daily volume in the money market with the average volume of transactions occurring on the New York Stock Exchange. If you look at the chart below, then you can see that the average daily transaction volume in the money market is nearly nine times larger than that took place on the NYSE.<br />
<br />
You may have ever exchanged your rupiah (IDR) to the US dollar (USD). Well, at that moment you are actually involved in the money market. The action of "converting" IDR to USD is a forex transaction! When you "swap" your IDR to USD, you are basically selling your IDR and at the same time: buy USD.<br />
As technology progresses, we can now perform similar transactions online. We do not need to go anywhere else to do forex transactions. Quite from home alone, which is important there is a computer and a connection to the Internet. Accompanied by a cup of coffee or warm tea, we can trade from our cushioned chairs or sofas.<br />
But there is a slight difference between forex trading that we will learn with Forex transactions that may be commonly done in most of our society in the bank or money changer. All we will do is a forex transaction with a contract system and a margin (margin). Those differences will be discussed one by one.<br />
Trade objects<br />
In this case, the trade object is still the same. What is it? Of course money. But what distinguishes with ordinary forex transactions is that we do not physically transact the currency. What we transact is a contract based on the value of the currency. May be a bit confusing. No need to confuse, there will be further explanation on this matter. But simply put, think of doing a certain currency transaction as if buying a particular country "stock". The currency movement of the country is an indirect representation of the market sentiment on the country's economy.<br />
There are several currencies called "major currency". They are the currency of developed countries and are transacted widely in the money market world. The following table is the list of currencies included in the major currency.
